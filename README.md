These android build scripts are written with ICU source v59.1

The download page is http://site.icu-project.org/download/59

And the direct link to download the archive is http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/59.1/icu4c-59_1-src.tgz

Download and extract the source first. Then merge with this repo to place the Android makefile at the right locations. Then use droid.bat under source folder to build the binaries. You might want to setup the build environment as required.
